# ADA Auditor — Agent Guide

This file is the project-level operating manual for coding agents (Cursor `AGENTS.md` / Claude.md equivalent). Follow it unless the user explicitly overrides it.

## Product

Evidence-first ADA/WCAG **accessibility risk auditor** for authenticated multi-step web apps. Hybrid system: deterministic checks + AI advisory. Not a legal certification authority.

Primary sources of truth:

- Spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-ada-auditor-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-ada-auditor-design.md)
- Implementation plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-28-ada-auditor.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-28-ada-auditor.md)

## Netflix-aligned engineering philosophy (non-negotiable)

User-locked principles for this repo:

1. **Chaos / steady-state confidence**
2. **Full-cycle: operate what you build**

Supporting Netflix practices we adopt:

- **Context, not control** — encode contracts and steady-state definitions; avoid process theater
- **Paved road** — one audit core; platform adapters enrich at the edge; opt-in adapters, not forked products
- **Minimize blast radius** — especially on customer production
- **Automate experiments continuously** — chaos hypotheses live as tests/scripts, not one-off manuals
- **Data over opinion** — CI/chaos results decide readiness to scale breadth

### Dual production surfaces

| Surface | Meaning | Blast radius |
|---|---|---|
| **Auditor platform** | Our Vercel-hosted control plane (APIs, cron, runners) | Chaos allowed with gates (`CHAOS_ENABLED`), auto-stop, structured logs |
| **Customer targets** | Sites/apps we audit | Production = strict action policy (mostly read-only); preview/staging richer; never exploratory destructive self-healing in customer prod |

### Steady-state rules (must not regress)

- Incomplete evidence → `ciStatus: 'inconclusive'` (never `pass`, never `fail`)
- Deterministic findings from incomplete evidence are **rejected**
- Explicit `platformHint` wins over rendered-DOM heuristics
- AI advisory is independent of deterministic hits; `gateable: false` in v1
- Run contracts are enforced (scope, confidence `minReport`, `failureMode`)
- Forbidden production actions never execute
- A run may only navigate to hosts in `scope.allowedDomains`; an empty scope
  denies everything rather than allowing it
- Credentials are referenced, never inlined — no secret in a request body, a
  stored journey, or a run log

### Full-cycle expectations

Anyone shipping a feature also ships:

- tests (prefer TDD: red → green → refactor)
- structured observability for new failure modes
- chaos/steady-state coverage when the change affects reliability semantics
- operable deploy path on **Vercel** (no “ops later”)

## Architecture boundaries

Follow `YAGNI → KISS → SRP → DRY`.

- `/src/domain` — contracts, policy, evidence, platforms (no HTTP/framework imports beyond validation libs)
- `/src/services` — orchestration (rule mapping, reporting, AI advisory, ax-tree pruning). Must not import Playwright or axe-core: browser work belongs in integrations, and keeping services framework-free is what keeps them in the fast unit suite, which excludes `tests/integrations/browser/**`.
- `/src/integrations` — browser, AI providers, platform adapters, schedulers
- `/src/app` or `/src/api` — Next.js / Vercel edges only
- Framework code at the edges; business rules in the center

`n8n` may orchestrate around the core; it must not become the audit brain.

## Testing policy

- Domain/service unit tests required for contract and reporting changes
- Chaos-style regressions required for steady-state claims (incomplete evidence, hint conflicts, scope fail-closed, complete-evidence CI fail path)
- Do not claim “done” without fresh `npm test`, `npm run test:browser`, `npm run chaos` and `npm run build` evidence
- Keep browser launches out of the unit suite. Handler tests mock the audit; the real browser is covered by `tests/integrations/browser/**` and by chaos.
- When adding Vercel routes: add route/handler tests or chaos script assertions for terminal statuses

## Current status

Implemented and verified locally + on Vercel preview:

- Domain contracts, evidence, policy, platforms
- **Rule engine: axe-core (~100 rules) against the live page.** One finding per
  offending element, each carrying a selector, WCAG success criteria, a
  conformance level, a help URL and a snippet. The scan runs in
  `integrations/browser/axe-scan.ts`; `services/deterministic-audit.ts` maps its
  plain-data output and imports neither Playwright nor axe-core.
- **AI advisory: a real `claude-opus-5` call** with strict tool use, over the
  pruned accessibility tree plus axe's undecided checks. Judges what rules
  cannot — alt text that says nothing, headings used for size, error text that
  does not say what to fix. Gated on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; absent or failing, the
  run completes without it. Always `gateable: false`.
- **Real targets.** `POST /api/audit/run` takes `targetUrl` and `steps`. Every
  target is checked on scheme, host, all resolved addresses, and again on the
  URL the page settled on after each navigation.
- Reporting (`pass|fail|inconclusive`), regression comparison keyed on
  rule + selector, `FileRunStore` + Upstash `KvRunStore`,
  `GET /api/audit/runs/latest`
- Chromium everywhere: the installed browser locally and in CI,
  `@sparticuz/chromium` on Vercel (`integrations/browser/launch.ts`)
- Tests: Vitest unit + browser suites green; `npm run chaos` green

### Known gaps

Read this before claiming something works.

- **A run still cannot outlive one function invocation.** `maxDuration` is 300s
  (the Hobby ceiling; Pro allows 800s). The 202 + poll shape unblocks the caller
  but does not add compute — background work is bounded by the same limit. A
  real site-wide crawl needs a container worker, not a bigger number here.
- **The console still blocks.** It calls `?wait=1`, because its run flow renders
  a result rather than polling. The async shape is there for API and CI callers.
- **No tenancy.** One shared `AUDITOR_RUN_TOKEN`, a flat `journeyId:environment`
  keyspace, and `accountId: 'acct-demo'` hardcoded. Any authenticated caller can
  read any run by guessing a journeyId.
- **The UI at `/` is a fixture prototype.** Roughly 7,000 lines with no `fetch`
  calls, no persistence and no auth. The working surface is `/console`.

## Agent behavior

- Do not invent Netflix process that isn’t grounded in these rules
- Prefer multitask/parallel agents for independent files/phases; serialize shared contract changes
- Do not edit plan files the user attached unless asked
- Ask before destructive git operations; commit only when asked (unless the user explicitly requests committing as part of the phase)
